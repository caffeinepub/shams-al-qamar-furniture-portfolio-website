  "summary": "Implemented the requested navigation/footer label rename to “Portfolio” (still linking to /gallery) and added a UI component to display/copy a “direct portfolio link” on the Gallery page. Updated gallery media manifest paths to point at /assets/generated/*. However, the diff does not provide evidence of an actual deployment/live URL, nor does it conclusively demonstrate that the original runtime/build error is identified and fixed beyond these UI/content changes.",

      "requirement": "Identify and fix the error reported in the current deployed draft so the portfolio site runs without runtime errors and builds successfully (no TypeScript errors, routing errors, or missing asset-path errors).",
      "reason": "The diff shows some UI/content updates (nav label change, gallery document.title update, gallery media paths), but does not show what the original error was or provide evidence that the build/runtime issue is fully resolved across all routes (e.g., no TypeScript/build output, no mention of fixed routing errors, and only partial evidence of asset-path correctness).",

      "reason": "No evidence in the diff summary of deployment configuration changes or any produced/public live URL. The added component computes a URL at runtime from window.location.origin, but that is not the same as providing a deployed live URL.",

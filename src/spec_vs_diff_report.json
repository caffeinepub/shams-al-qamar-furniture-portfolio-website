  "summary": "Implemented a multi-page TanStack Router structure with shared header/footer layout, warm neutral/gold theme styling, service content data with per-service media strips, and a gallery media/lightbox component scaffold. However, the required generated brand image assets are not evidenced in the diff, and some unrelated/auth-template hook files appear to have been added despite not being requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Add required generated brand images to the project as static assets under frontend/public/assets/generated and use them in the UI with the exact filenames specified.",
      "reason": "Header/Footer reference the generated logo filename, but the diff summary does not show the required image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated (nor the hero background image). Without those assets present, the requirement/AC about the files existing with exact filenames is not verifiable from the diff evidence.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Added/implemented Internet Identity and actor/react-query hooks (useActor, useInternetIdentity) and a reserved backend query hook file, which are not part of the portfolio website requirements.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly focuses on marketing/portfolio pages, gallery, services, contact, theme, and static assets. No requirement asks to add or alter authentication/actor hooks or react-query integration; these changes are extraneous to the requested feature set based on the diff summary.",

    },
    {
      "description": "Introduced a backend Motoko actor file with an empty actor body.",
      "reason": "While the constraints say to keep a single Motoko actor, the BuildRequest does not request any backend implementation changes or a new empty backend actor file; this appears unrelated to the requested frontend portfolio features.",

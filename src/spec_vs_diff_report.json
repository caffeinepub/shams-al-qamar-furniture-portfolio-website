  "summary": "The diff updates the Services page to conditionally render a MediaStrip for additional offerings with a mediaCategory, and adds a mediaCategory for the Carpet Installation offering. However, the required carpet image assets were not added (no new files), and the required galleryMedia.ts changes for removing full-interior items and adding carpet items cannot be confirmed from the truncated diff.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Remove all existing gallery images for the 'Full Interior Fit-outs' service so it shows the empty-gallery placeholder (no thumbnails).",
      "reason": "The change must be made in frontend/src/content/galleryMedia.ts by removing all GalleryItem entries with category: 'full-interior', but the provided diff for galleryMedia.ts is truncated and does not show whether any 'full-interior' entries were removed or still exist.",

      "reason": "No new files were added in the diff (Added: 0), so the 6 required static assets are not present. Also, galleryMedia.ts is truncated and does not show any new carpet category entries being added.",

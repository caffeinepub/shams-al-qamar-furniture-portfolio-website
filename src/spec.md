# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the current dull dark-wood site background with a more engaging, futuristic furniture/interior-themed backdrop while keeping all content readable.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the global layout/background styling so all pages using `SiteLayout` use the new futuristic background image instead of `wood-dark-bg`.
- Adjust global CSS background overlays/gradients (e.g., opacity, tint) to maintain strong contrast and readability on top of the new background.
- Align the Home page hero background treatment (existing image layer/overlays/gradients) with the new global futuristic aesthetic without changing any user-facing copy.

**User-visible outcome:** The site displays a cohesive, modern futuristic furniture-themed background across pages (including the Home hero) with text and UI remaining easy to read.

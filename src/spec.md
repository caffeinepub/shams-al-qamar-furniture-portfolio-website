# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a responsive, multi-page portfolio website for “Shams Al Qamar Furniture” using the provided English business copy, with a consistent interiors/furniture visual theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a multi-page marketing site with top navigation (not a single-page slide deck) and consistent, non-blue/purple interiors-themed styling.
- Implement core pages/sections: Home/Title (company name, tagline “Crafting Elegance, Tailoring Spaces”, founder/role placeholder, contact summary, QR code block), About, Vision & Mission, and Services overview.
- Add dedicated service pages or clearly separated sections for: Curtains & Drapes (incl. motorized), Wallpaper Solutions, Full Interior Fit-outs (residential & commercial), Turnkey Service, plus additional offerings list (carpet/PVC carpet installation, roller/vertical blinds, parquet flooring, sofa upholstery/new sofa sets), each with media slots.
- Add a Gallery/Work area supporting images and videos, organized/filtered by service categories, using manually added local/static assets (no automated social scraping).
- Add a Contact page/section with email, named phone contacts, and location, including mailto: and tel: links, and ensure contact info is discoverable via nav/footer.
- Add social links (Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat) in header and/or footer using the exact provided URLs, opening in a new tab.
- Add and use required generated brand images as static assets under `frontend/public/assets/generated` (logo in header; hero background/image on Home).

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors can navigate a polished, responsive multi-page furniture portfolio site, view services and categorized work media, and quickly contact the business via email/phone, location info, QR code, and social links.

This directory is for manually added gallery images and videos.

To add media to the gallery:

2. Place them in this directory with descriptive filenames
3. Update frontend/src/content/galleryMedia.ts to reference the new files

Example filename structure:

- wallpaper-textured-design-1.jpg
- interior-residential-project-1.mp4

Supported formats:

Note: Do not use automated scraping tools. All media must be manually downloaded
and added to comply with platform terms of service.
